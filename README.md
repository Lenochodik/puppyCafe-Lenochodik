# Puppy Café

## 🤔 What is this game about?
This game is about a puppy who is running his own café. It's based on the classic arcade game [Tapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapper_(video_game)) (1984).
Customers come in wanting their drink (pumpkin latte), you have to serve them! Some of them are really thirsty so they will slide you a cup back, so be prepared to serve them another and catch that cup so it doesn't break!
Be quick! This game gets faster as it goes!

## ❓ Rules
- Serve the customer by sliding him a drink
- If he sends a cup back, you have to catch it
- Don't slide the drink on a desk where is no customer (because it'll break at the end of the desk)
- Don't let your customers wait too long, because they are going to get mad at you (wait for the animation - that should clarify it)
- The game gets faster every 30 seconds of gameplay
